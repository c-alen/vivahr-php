# VIVAHR PHP SDK

A PHP SDK for integrating with the VIVAHR API, supporting job posting, candidate management, and more.

## Installation

To install the VIVAHR PHP SDK, ensure you have Composer installed. Then, run the following command:

```bash
composer require vivahr/vivahr-php
```

## Requirements

Make sure you have:

- PHP 7.0 or higher
- Composer

## Usage

Hereâ€™s how to initialize the SDK and perform various operations:

```php
require 'vendor/autoload.php';
```

### Step 1: Authenticate and get an access token

```php
use VIVAHR\Auth\Authentication;

$client_id = 'XXXXXXXXXX';
$client_secret = 'XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX';

// Use this for Production
$api_url = 'https://auth.vivahr.com';

// Use this for Sandbox testing
$api_url = 'https://api-sandbox.vivahr.com';

$auth_token_path = '/oauth/token';

$auth = new Authentication($client_id , $client_secret, $api_url . $auth_token_path);
$accessTokenData = $auth->generateAccessToken();
$accessToken = $accessTokenData['access_token'];
```
  
### Step 2: Initialize the client

```php
use VIVAHR\VivahrClient;

$vivahrClient = new VivahrClient($accessToken, $api_url);
```

### Now you can make calls to the endpoints

```php

$jobs = $vivahrClient->jobs()->list([
    "offset"=> "",
    "limit"=> "",
    "keyword"=> "",
    "department_id"=> "",
    "location_id"=> "",
    "sort_field"=> "",
    "sort_direction"=> "",
    "hide_inactive"=> ""
]);
echo json_encode($jobs);
```
